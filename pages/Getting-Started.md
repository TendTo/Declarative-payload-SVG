## Installing

To install the package and make it available in a node.js project, simply install it with npm

```bash
npm install --save dp-svg
```

### Importing

Once it has been installed, it can easily be imported in your project, depending on the import method you need.

```js
// Common js module
const { Test } = require('dp-svg');
// ESM module
import { Test } from 'dp-svg';
```

## Web Browser

It is generally better practice (for security reasons) to copy the [library](https://unpkg.com/dp-svg@0.0.1/dist/bundle/dp-svg.min.js) to your own web server and serve it yourself, but for prototyping (or laziness) you can load it directly in the html file with the **script** tag.

```html
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/dp-svg@0.0.1/dist/bundle/dp-svg.min.js"
  type="application/javascript"
  async
></script>
```

## Basic example

```js
// TODO
```
